# CCJS 621: General Linear Models in Criminal Justice Research

* Instructor: Robert Brame
* Course Meets in LeFrak 1222 on Monday evenings from 4:00-6:45pm.
* My office hours: Wednesdays 10-12 and by appointment; my office is 2139 LeFrak Hall
* Catalog Description: An in-depth exploration of applied linear regression analysis. Covers characteristics of estimates, such as unbiasedness and efficiency. Encourages fluency with the theoretical issues involved in the basic linear regression using simple algebra, familiarity with the general model using matrix algebra, and fluency with the computer application of multivariate regressions and the probit/logit models. Prerequisite: CCJS 620 or equivalent; please see me if you have any questions about your preparation for the class.
* Course-related policies: In all matters, the class will follow University guidance as outlined [here](https://gradschool.umd.edu/faculty-and-staff/course-related-policies).
* Course content: In addition to the textbooks (listed below), I will also assign some supplementary readings. Some of the work you will be doing will involve hand calculations on simple datasets and some will involve problems where you will need to rely on the computer. I will be posting relevant content for the course on this webpage throughout the semester so please bookmark the site and check it regularly.
* Accessibility accommodations: If you think you might need one or more academic accommodations, please contact the Accessibility and Disability Service Office ([link](https://ads.umd.edu)) for guidance and assistance.
* Statistical software: I will be using R in this course. You can obtain R for your computer at this [website](https://www.r-project.org) or you can use the R software that is installed on lab computers across campus. 
* Grades: there will be 4 take-home assignments throughout the semester. Each assignment will be worth 1/4 of your final grade and will be graded on a 100-point scale; each individual grade will be rounded to the nearest integer (so, for example, a 94.8 rounds up to 95 and a 94.3 rounds down to 94). At the end of the semester, I will add up your (rounded) grades on the 4 assignments and then I will divide the sum by 4 to get your final numeric grade which will also be rounded to the nearest integer. Letter grades will be assigned as follows: 98-100=A+, 93-97=A, 90-92=A-, 88-89=B+, 83-87=B, 80-82=B-, 78-79=C+, 73-77=C, 70-72=C-, 68-69=D+, 63-67=D, 60-62=D-, and all grades lower than 60=F.
* Assignment submission rules: assignments are due on ELMS at 11:59pm on the due date and must be submitted as a pdf file. If you submit your assignment in any other form than a pdf file, you will receive an automatic 10-point deduction.  It is your responsibility to make sure the pdf file you submit can be opened and read. File submissions that cannot be opened or read will receive a grade of 0. In the unlikely event that there is an ELMS or Canvas problem at the deadline time, you can submit your assignment to me by email (rbrame@umd.edu) but the time stamp of the email will be marked as the submission time. Such emails must originate from your UMD email account or they will not be accepted.
* Late submission of assignments: If you submit your assignment after the 11:59pm deadline, there will be a 5-point grade penalty for each hour the submission is late (so, for a submission arriving at midnight up through 12:59am, the penalty is 5 points; if the submission arrives at 1:00am up through 1:59am, the penalty is 10 points, etc.). If an emergency arises and you are unable to submit your assignment, you are expected to notify me no later than the time the assignment is due and to supply appropriate documentation to support your excuse. The documentation must demonstrate incapacity to work on the assignment for a substantial fraction of the time between when the assignment is posted and the time it is due. If the emergency is such that you are unable to notify me by the time the assignment is due, your excuse must also include documentation to justify the delay in notification. Once I have reviewed the documentation, I will make a judgment about whether an extension is warranted.
* Attendance expectations for classes: My expectation is that you will attend all of the class sessions. If you have to miss a class, I encourage you to work with other people in the class to get caught up on your notes and contact me if you need clarification.
* Academic integrity: the guiding principle in this class is that the work you submit should be your own work. This means you are not permitted to discuss assignment problems with other students, share R code to solve assignment problems with other students, or use artificial intelligence to obtain R code or to solve assignment problems. If credible evidence of a rule violation materializes, it will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in accordance with the University's Academic Integrity Policy ([website](https://policies.umd.edu/academic-affairs/university-of-maryland-code-of-academic-integrity)). Please note that an Academic Integrity referral does *not* mean that you have been found responsible for a violation or that I have concluded you are responsible for a violation. It means that an issue of concern has been noted and that the Office of Student Conduct will examine it carefully. A determination of responsibility will only be reached after the Office of Student Conduct has completed its investigation with appropriate due process; as an instructor, my role in the process is a limited one.
